### Overview

`cr` is a job executor concerned with achieving the highest parallel execution possible.

Given a definition of jobs and their dependencies, it builds a graph that outlines the execution plan of these jobs.

For instance, consider the following plan:


```yaml
Jobs:
  - Id: 'SayFoo'
    Run: 'echo foo'

  - Id: 'SayBaz'
    Run: 'echo baz'
    DependsOn: [ 'SayFoo' ]

  - Id: 'SayCaz'
    Run: 'echo caz'
    DependsOn: [ 'SayFoo' ]
```

This plan states that we have 3 jobs to be executed: `SayFoo`, `SayBaz` and `SayCaz` but the last two jobs must only be executed after the first one and in case it succeeds. 

To visualize the execution plan we can run it with `--graph`, which validates the plan and prints out a [dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)) digraph.


```sh
# Execute CR telling it where the execution
# plan is (execution.yaml) and that it should
# just print the graph and exit.
cr --file ./execution.yaml  --graph

digraph {
	compound = "true"
	newrank = "true"
	subgraph "root" {
		"[root] SayFoo" -> "[root] SayBaz"
		"[root] SayFoo" -> "[root] SayCaz"
		"[root] _root" -> "[root] SayFoo"
	}
}

# If we pipe this to `dot` and than take the output
# of `dot` we can see the visual representation of the 
# digraph.

cr --file ./examples/hello-world.yaml --graph \
        | dot -Tpng > ./assets/hello-world.graph.png
```

### Spec


```yaml
---
# Configurations that control the runtime environment.
# These are configurations that can be specified via
# the `cr` CLI (cli takes precedence).
Runtime:
  LogDirectory: '/tmp'  # base directory to use to store log files
  Stdout: false         # whether all logs should also go to stdout     
  Directory: './'       # default directory to be used as CWD


# Map of environment variables to include in every job 
# execution.
# This can be be overriden by job-specific environments
Env:
  FOO: 'BAR'


# Jobs is a list of `Job` objects.
# Each job can have its properties templated
# using results of other jobs, even if they
# depend on the result of a job execution.
Jobs: 
  - Id: MyJob           # name of the job being executed.
    Run: 'echo test'    # command to run
    Directory: '/tmp'   # directory to use as cwd in the execution
    CaptureOutput: true # whether the output of the task should be stored in `.Output` variable
    Env:                # Variables to merge into the environment of the command
      FOO: 'BAR'
    DependsOn:          # List of strings specifying jobs that should be executed before this 
      - 'AnotherJob'    # job and that must exit succesfully.
    LogFilepath: '/log' # Path to the file where the logs of this execution should be stored.
                        # By default they're stored under `/tmp/<NameOfTheJob>`.

```
